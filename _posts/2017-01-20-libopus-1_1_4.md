This [Opus 1.1.4](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/opus/opus-1.1.4.tar.gz)
release fixes a single bug. A specially-crafted Opus packet could cause
an integer wrap-around in the SILK LSF stabilization code. This would cause
an out-of-bounds read 256 bytes before a constant table. In most circumstances,
the consequences are harmless and the result is simply noise in the audio.

This was reported as [CVE-2017-0381](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0381).
Contrary to that report, [our own analysis](https://git.xiph.org/?p=opus.git;a=commit;h=70a3d641b760b3d313b6025f82aed93a460720e5) shows that no
remote code execution is possible. However, we are making this release
as a precaution.
