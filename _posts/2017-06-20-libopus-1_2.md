This [Opus 1.2](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/opus/opus-1.2.tar.gz) major release
brings many quality improvements, new features, and bug fixes. You can read all the details
in this [release demo page](https://people.xiph.org/~jm/opus/opus-1.2/). Changes since 1.1.x include:
- Speech quality improvements especially in the 12-20 kbit/s range
- Improved VBR encoding for hybrid mode
- More aggressive use of wider speech bandwidth, including fullband speech starting at 14 kbit/s
- Music quality improvements in the 32-48 kb/s range
- Generic and SSE CELT optimizations
- Support for directly encoding packets up to 120 ms
- DTX support for CELT mode
- SILK CBR improvements
- Support for all of the fixes in draft-ietf-codec-opus-update-06 (the mono downmix and the folding fixes need `--enable-update-draft`)
- Many bug fixes, including integer wrap-arounds discovered through fuzzing (no security implications)

There are no known regressions compared to the latest stable release (1.1.5). Please report any problems.
