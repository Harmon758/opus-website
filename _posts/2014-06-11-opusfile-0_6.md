The opusfile library provides seeking, decode, and playback of Opus streams in the Ogg
container (.opus files) including over http(s) on posix and windows systems.

Changes since the v0.5 release:

-  Fix bugs with comment handling
-  Fix build for BSD
-  Fix bugs handling invalid and non-opus streams

Some of these bugs kept basic functionality of the APIs from working at all, so we
recommend all users upgrade.
