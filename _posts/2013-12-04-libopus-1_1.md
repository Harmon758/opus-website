Opus 1.1 includes:

-  New analysis code and tuning that significantly improves encoding quality, especially for variable-bitrate (VBR)
-  Automatic detection of speech or music to decide which encoding mode to use
-  Surround with good quality at 128 kbps for 5.1 and usable down to 48 kbps
-  Speed improvements on all architectures, especially ARM, where decoding uses around 40% less CPU and encoding uses around 30% less CPU

These improvements are explained in more details in [Monty's demo](http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/opus/demo3.shtml) (updated from the 1.1 beta demo).
