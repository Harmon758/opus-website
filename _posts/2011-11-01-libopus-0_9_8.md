This version matches version -10 of the draft and fixes several glitches caused
by mode switching and other corner cases. This required breaking the bit-stream
for the SILK-only stereo and hybrid stereo modes. Fortunately, these modes are
not often used, so few users should be affected. This release also implements a
CBR mode for SILK mode.

This release includes a much better test suite and has been extensively tested
in multiple configurations. See the [Jenkins build system][jenkins] and the resulting
[floating-point coverage][floating] and [fixed-point coverage][fixed]. Now that the
analysis and documentation of the code has been completed, further changes to the
bit-stream until the final freeze are unlikely.
