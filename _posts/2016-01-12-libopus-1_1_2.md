Opus 1.1.2 includes:

-  Fixes encoder or decoder state reset, which would previously disable some run-time selected architecture-specific optimizations; and
-  Fixes hybrid mode discontinuous transmission (DTX) operation, where the comfort noise above 8 kHz was incorrectly estimated and could
   oscillate in time.

None of these bugs were regressions over previous releases.
