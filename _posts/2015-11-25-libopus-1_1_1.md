-  x86 SSE, SSE2 and SSE4.1 intrinsics optimizations with run-time CPU detection contributed by [Cisco Systems][cisco],
-  MIPS intrinsics optimizations contributed by [Imagination Technologies][imagination],
-  ARM Neon optimizations contributed by [Linaro][linaro] and [ARM][arm],
-  many architecture-independent optimizations and memory footprint reductions that should improve performance on all platforms, and
-  several minor bug fixes.

The quality of the encoder should be mostly unchanged compared to version 1.1.
