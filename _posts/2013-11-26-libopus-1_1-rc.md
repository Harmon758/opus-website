Compared to 1.1-beta, this new release further improves surround encoding quality.
It also includes better tuning of surround and stereo for lower bitrates.
The complexity has been reduced on all CPUs, but especially ARM, which now has
Neon assembly for the encoder. At last, there are a few bugfixes.
