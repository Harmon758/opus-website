In this release the Opus decoder opusdec has been converted to use the
opusfile library, and the Opus encoder opusenc has been converted to use
the libopusenc library.  These libraries make it easy to robustly read
and write Ogg Opus audio files, and enable some new features.  Both
libraries are available on the
[Downloads](https://opus-codec.org/downloads/) page.

opusdec enhancements include:
- Read directly from http or https sources
- New option --force-stereo will force stereo output
- Improved support for chained input files with differing sample rate or
    channel count
- A summary is displayed for METADATA\_BLOCK\_PICTURE tags rather than
    displaying the base64-encoded data

opusenc enhancements include:
- Delayed decision support allows the encoder to look ahead up to two
    seconds in order to improve encoding decisions
- The options --music and --speech can be used to tune low bitrate audio
    for music or speech, overriding automatic detection
- The option --no-phase-inv disables the use of phase inversion for
    intensity stereo, which can be useful for streams that are likely to
    be downmixed to mono after decoding
- New --tracknumber shortcut for setting tracknumber metadata

Additionally:
- The opusinfo utility can display the demixing matrix from Ogg Opus
    files using ambisonics channel mapping family 3
- The experimental opusrtp tool supports new options to specify RTP
    payload type, Ogg Opus output file, original sample rate, and number
    of channels, and supports improved transmit timing, arbitrary
    network devices, and IPv6
- The Visual Studio 2015 project builds opusenc support for FLAC input
- The old Visual Studio 2010 project has been removed
- Numerous bug fixes are also included
