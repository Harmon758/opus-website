This [Opus 1.1.3](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/opus/opus-1.1.3.tar.gz) release focuses mainly on
optimizations and bug fixes. Changes include:

- Neon optimizations improving performance on ARMv7 and ARMv8 by up to 15%
- Fixes some issues with 16-bit platforms (e.g. TI C55x)
- Fixes to comfort noise generation (CNG)
- Documenting that PLC packets can also be 2 bytes
- Includes experimental ambisonics work (--enable-ambisonics)

None of the bugs that were fixed were regressions over previous releases.
