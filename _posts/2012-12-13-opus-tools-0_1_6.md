This release includes many build fixes, especially for Windows, as well as some minor correctness
improvements. The opusenc `--uncoupled` switch is no longer advertised because this debugging option
was being mistaken for a quality enhancement.

An experiemental `opusrtp` tool is new in this release. It is not installed by default because it's of
limited usefulness, mostly for debugging other RTP implementations. It can send an Opus file over RTP
or record a packet stream to an Opus file, on POSIX systems.
