This version matches version -14 of the draft and fixes minor issues brought up
before the upcoming IETF last call. There is no change to the bit-stream.

Internet-Draft: [draft-ietf-codec-opus-14.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-codec-opus-14.txt)

Libopus versions 0.9.11 - 0.9.13 were skipped to synchronize release and draft numbering.
