Opus libopus 0.9.1 fixes a few minor bugs that were found in version libopus 0.9.0.
Unfortunately, this has required slight changes to the bit-stream, which is thus not
compatible with libopus 0.9.0. This release adds support for forward error correction
(FEC), which improves performance under packet loss.
