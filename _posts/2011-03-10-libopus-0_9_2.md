Opus libopus 0.9.2 adds support for glitchless switching between the voice and audio mode.
Also, the encoder now defaults to a new "automatic" mode and bandwidth selection and
attempts to select the optimal mode and bandwidth considering the bitrate and voice content.
Several bugs were also fixed and the codec and test tools should be more robust in general.
