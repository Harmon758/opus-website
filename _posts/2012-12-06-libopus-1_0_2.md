Opus 1.0.2 fixes an out-of-bounds read that could be triggered by a malicious Opus packet causing an
integer wrap-around in the padding code. Considering that the packet would have to be at least 16 MB
in size and that no out-of-bounds write is possible, the severity is very low. Other changes include
fixes and improvements to the PLC and hybrid mode quality improvements. As usual, this release is
fully compliant with the Opus specification.
